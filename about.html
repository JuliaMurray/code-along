   <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
   
   <p>We are so glad you found us!  Our mission is to assist those returning to work to develop a wardrobe that represents their style and comfort level. The WFR revolution shook up life as we know it.  We traded our office business attire of dresses, suits, ties, uniforms, etc. for yoga pants, boxers, slippers, sneakers, t-shirts, and who knows what else. Now, the hybrid schedule has arrived and it's time to go back to the office (at least for a couple of days).  Most of have evolved and changed in various ways.  The wardrobe we used before has become stale and outdated.  It may no longer reflect who we are now.  We may have gained or lost weight so that those clothes don't fit anymore.  But where to start?</p>

   <p>Now there's Mirror.  A revolutionary way to build a new wardrobe that reflects the new you, your values, your style, your verve.  Instead of endless hours of shopping in malls, outlet stores,and online, just answer a few questions, a few clicks, and voila!, Mirror will build you a wardrobe that is well, YOU.</p>
   
   <p>You may</p>
