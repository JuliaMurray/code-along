#hack23-hackalong Project: Zoom2BoardroomFashions.com E-Commerce Website

A group of women from all over the country came together to learn, laugh and launch a website during the Girl Develop It Hackathon.  We all tried new things, worked very hard and created a website catering to people who have been working from home in their stretchy pants and now have to return to the office.

UX/UI Team used Figma to wireframe the website. Bootstrap was added to all of the pages.  
We designed a logo using Canva

Developers used HTML, CSS, JavaScript to create and collaborate in Replit and GitHub.
